Simple Shell
This project is meant to test my understanding of C programming Language.

/* GUIDELINES ON HOW SHELL WORKS */
1.  Display the prompt.    (Using an infinite loop)
2.  Read user inputs.      (Using the getline function)
3.  Parsing the command.   (Using the strtok function to tokenize the string)
4.  Searching for the command.
5.  Create a child process. (Using the fork system call)
6.  Execute the command.    (Using the execve system call)
7.  Wait for the command above to complete.   (Using the wait system call)
8.  Display the output.
9.  Return to prompt.
10. Exit the shell.
